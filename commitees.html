      <li><b>Launching a peacekeeping mission in Libya</b>
<br>Libya is the fourth largest state in Northern Africa bordering Egypt, Sudan, Niger, Chad,
Algeria and the Mediterranean Sea and its capital is Tripoli. In 1951, Libya became an
independent kingdom until 1969, when a military coup led by Colonnel Muammar Gaddafi
overthrew King Idris I. Gaddafi ruled in Libya until the First Libyan Civil War (2011)
between those supporting his regime and those opposing it, with the latter being supported
by NATO. The conflict ended with Gaddafi being executed and the General National
Congress (GNC) seizing power after the elections held in 2012 while replacing the National
Transitional Council (NTC). Meanwhile, an unofficial government in Tobruk, the Council
of Deputies (later known as the House of Representatives or HoR), was organised. In 2013,
the GNC extended its mandate for at least one year, although it should have been dissolved.
In 2014, the HoR was democratically elected and was recognized as the official
government of Libya. Thus, Libya was consisted of two rivalling power bases, the GNC
supported by Islamist groups and the HoR by anti-Islamist ones.</li>

      <li><b>Protection of children in armed conflict</b>

     <br>
The Human Rights Council is part of the United Nations since 2006. It consists of 47
States responsible for promoting and protecting all human rights globally. It makes sure
that all people have the same rights and are aware of them. It checks what governments
do to protect their people and whether or not they implement what has been agreed on at
the United Nations. But most importantly, it helps people whose rights were taken away.
Unfortunately, history proves that children have always been part of armed conflict. They
have no other choice than to encounter the same horrors as adults, either as casualties or
even as child soldiers. Children are particularly vulnerable in diseases, food and water 
shortages, since their growing bodies need steady supplies of essential nutrients.
Moreover children is easily traumatized for the rest of their lives from being exposed to
violence and brutal death.

      <li><b> Tackling the issue of human trafficking;
Prevention, protection and prosecution</b><br>Human-trafficking constitutes one of the biggest criminal networks on the international
scenery, with many different stakeholders being involved in its expansion all over the world.
According to the author Kevin Bales, around 27 million people are modern-day slaves across
the globe. Back in 2008 the U.S Department of State estimated that approximately 2 million
children were exploited for sex trade. Generally, women and girls make up more than 50% of
all sex slaves in the world. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), forced
labour alone (one component of human trafficking) generates an estimated $150 billion in
profits per annum as of 2014. Human trafficking is listed as a crime in Article 83 of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</li>

      <li><b>Achieving sustainable development; universal access to
clean water</b>
<br>
Although the universal access to clean water is a prerequisite for sustainable
development, a growing number of incidents and factors display significant role in the
deceleration of the current progress. Clearly, the complexity of the issues lies in the
interlinkages that water acquires with the economies, the environment and the
governments. .</li>

      <li><b>Improvements	to	the	International	Arrest	Warrant	system</b>
<br>
After the creation of the United Nations in 1945, international methods of
solving the problems of peace and security began to be shared amongst different
countries and regions. Visions of empire and dominant nations in the world system
began to decrease. The main reason, a basic staple of international cooperation in
the solution to global problems, cooperation.</li>
